# [Python Memory Management and Tips Course](https://talkpython.fm/memory)

[![](./readme_resources/python-memory-mgmt.png)](https://talkpython.fm/memory)

This very unique course will teach **not just how Python memory management works** 
and how to create code that functions well within that world, it will provide
many **concrete techniques, tools, design patterns, and more to make your programs
more memory efficient** and computationally faster to boot.

If Python memory (allocations, clean up, and so on) has always felt like a weird
black box that you have had to take for granted, **join this course and open that box**.
There are many beautiful and interesting aspects of Python's runtime behavior making
your code run. You should understand what's happening on your behalf.


## What topics are covered

In this course, you will:

* Learn how Python variables and data structures actually look in the CPython layer
* See how **the small object allocator** treats most objects differently than your intuition
* Understand Python's memory allocation primitives: **blocks**, **pools**, and **arenas**
* Locate the **elements on C code** responsible for Python memory behavior
* See **reference counting in action** with live code explorations
* Discover why **reference counting alone is not enough** for memory cleanup
* **Work with Python's GC** and see when it's needed, and when it's not 
* **Compare different data structures** to get a sense of their relative size
* Use multiple clever but simple techniques to **massively reduce memory during function calls**
* **Lighten up your classes** with properties
* Leverage multiple memory profilers to **investigate memory usage** line by line and over time
* And lots more


## Who is this course for?

This course is for **anyone who wants to understand how Python memory is managed 
and make their code more efficient and faster**. If you're tired of Python memory being a black box
hiding its behavior, turn on the light with this course.

The student requirements are quite light for this course. You'll need Basic Python language knowledge:

* Classes
* Functions
* Properties
* Variables
* Loops
* I# typescript

Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript
Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action.üöÄ

This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction. See the Hello World JavaScript Action

Create an action from this template
Click the Use this Template and provide the new repo details for your action

Code in Main
Install the dependencies

$ npm install
Build the typescript and package it for distribution

$ npm run build && npm run package
Run the tests ‚úîÔ∏è

$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ‚úì throws invalid number (3ms)
  ‚úì wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ‚úì test runs (95ms)

...
Change action.yml
The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the documentation

Change the Code
Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try { 
      ...
  } 
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
See the toolkit documentation for the various packages.

Publish to a distribution branch
Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run ncc and push the results:

$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
Note: We recommend using the --license option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! üöÄ

See the versioning documentation

Validate
You can now validate the action by referencing ./ in a workflow in your repo (see test.yml)

uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
See the actions tab for runs of this action! üöÄ

Usage:
After testing you can create a v1 tag to reference the stable and latest V1 action
